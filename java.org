* Important Caveats
** == and equals
*** Operators work differently on Objects than primitives.
*** When checking if objects are equal, the == operator will say they are the same.
*** The method, equal, checks if they are logically equal. 
*** Description
The operator == works a bit different on objects than on primitives. When we are using objects and want to check if they are equal, the operator == wiil say if they are the same, if you want to check if they are logically equal, you should use the equals method on the object. For example:

String a = new String("Wow");
String b = new String("Wow");
String sameA = a;

boolean r1 = a == b;      // This is false, since a and b are not the same object
boolean r2 = a.equals(b); // This is true, since a and b are logically equals
boolean r3 = a == sameA;  // This is true, since a and sameA are really the same object

*** String
**** Create a string with a constructor
String s1 = new String("Who let the dogs out?");
**** Just using "" creates a string, so no need to write it the previous way.
String s2 = "Who who who who!";
**** Java defined the operator + on strings to concatenate:
String s3 = s1 + s2;
*** Boolean

Every comparison operator in java will return the type boolean that not like other languages can only accept two special values: true or false.

boolean b = false;

b = true;

boolean toBe = false;
b = toBe || !toBe;
if (b) {
    System.out.println(toBe);
}

int children = 0;
b = children; // Will not work
if (children) { // Will not work
    // Will not work
}

*** Arrays

int[] ary;
arr = new int[10];
arr[0] = 4;
arr[1] = arr[0] + 5;
System.out.println(arr.length);
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};



** Loops
*** for
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {}

*** while
while (condition) {}


*** do
do {

} while(condition);

*** foreach
int[] arr = {2, 0, 1, 3};
for (int el : arr) {
    System.out.println(el);
}
**** equivalent

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    int el = arr[i];
    System.out.println(el);
}

*** break
break will cause the loop to stop and will go immediately to the next statement after the loop:

**** example
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i >= 2) {
        break;
    }
    System.out.println("Yuhu");
}
System.out.println(i);
// Output:
// Yuhu
// Yuhu
// 2

*** continue
continue will stop the current iteration and will move to the next one. Notice that inside a for loop, it will still run the third section.

**** example
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i >= 3) {
        break;
    }
    System.out.println("Yuhu");
    if (i >= 1) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println("Tata");
}
System.out.println(i);
// Output
// Yuhu
// Tata
// Yuhu
// Yuhu
// 3


** Functions 
*** Basic Explanation
**** All function definitions must be inside classes.
**** Function are aka methods
In Java, all function definitions must be inside classes. We also call functions methods. 
**** Example Code
public class Main {
    public static void foo() {
        // Do something here
    }
}

**** Structure
***** public
      it's a public method accessible by other objects
***** static
      It's a method that can accessed as a class method
***** void
      void is the return type
***** foo
      Is the method name


      
*** Summary
**** Every Java method has to be within a class
**** Static methods belong to a class 
**** Non-static methods belong to objects
**** All parameters to functions are passed by value
**** Primitives content is copied
**** Objects are not copied and some would say 'passed by reference'
     
* Maven
** TODO Checklist [0/2]
 - [ ] Create a Maven project
 - [ ] 
** Public Repos
** Description

Maven, a Yiddish word meaning accumulator of knowledge, was originally started as an attempt to simplify the build processes in the Jakarta Turbine project. There were several projects each with their own Ant build files that were all slightly different and JARs were checked into CVS. We wanted a standard way to build the projects, a clear definition of what the project consisted of, an easy way to publish project information and a way to share JARs across several projects.

The result is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project. We hope that we have created something that will make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project.

** Objectives
   
Maven’s primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts to deal with:

Making the build process easy
Providing a uniform build system
Providing quality project information
Providing guidelines for best practices development
Allowing transparent migration to new features

* Questions
** DONE What is a JAR file?

In software, JAR (Java Archive) is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file to distribute application software or libraries on the Java platform.

JAR files are fundamentally archive files, built on the ZIP file format and have the .jar file extension. Computer users can create or extract JAR files using the jar command that comes with a JDK. They can also use zip tools to do so; however, the order of entries in the zip file headers is important when compressing, as the manifest often needs to be first. Inside a JAR, file names are unicode text

*** Design

A JAR file allows Java runtimes to efficiently deploy a set of classes and their associated resources. The elements in a JAR file can be compressed, which, together with the ability to download an entire application in a single request, makes downloading a JAR file much more convenient than separately downloading the many uncompressed files which would form a single Java Application. The package java.util.zip contains classes that read and write JAR files.

A JAR file has an optional manifest file located in the path META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. The entries in the manifest file determine how one can use the JAR file. For instance, a Classpath entry can be used to specify other JAR files for loading with the JAR. This entry consists of a list of absolute or relative paths to other JAR files. Although intended to simplify JAR use, in practice it turns out to be notoriously brittle, as it depends on all the relevant JARs being in the exact locations specified when the entry-point JAR was built. To change versions or locations of libraries, a new manifest is needed.

To extract the contents of a JAR file users can use any standard unzip software, or the jar command that comes with every Java Virtual Machine: "jar -xf foo.jar".
Developers can digitally sign JAR files. In that case, the signature information becomes part of the embedded manifest file. The JAR itself is not signed, but instead every file inside the archive is listed along with its checksum; it is these checksums that are signed. Multiple entities may sign the JAR file, changing the JAR file itself with each signing, although the signed files themselves remain valid. When the Java runtime loads signed JAR files, it can validate the signatures and refuse to load classes that do not match the signature. It can also support 'sealed' packages, in which the Classloader will only permit Java classes to be loaded into the same package if they are all signed by the same entities. This prevents malicious code from being inserted into an existing package, and so gaining access to package-scoped classes and data.

Developers can obfuscate JAR files so that a user of the JAR file doesn't get much information regarding the code it contains, or to reduce its size, which is useful in Embedded system development, where space may be limited.

*** Manifest
On the Java platform, a Manifest file is a specific file contained within a JAR file.[5][6] It is used to define extension and package-related data. It is a metadata file that contains name-value pairs organized in different sections. If a JAR file is intended to be used as an executable file, the manifest file specifies the main class of the application. The manifest file is named MANIFEST.MF.
It is not uncommon to find a computer file described as a manifest in situations unrelated to Java.
    


*** Executable JAR files

An executable Java program can be packaged in a JAR file, along with any libraries the program uses. Executable JAR files have the manifest specifying the entry point class with Main-Class: myPrograms.MyClass and an explicit Class-Path (and the -cp argument is ignored). Some operating systems can run these directly when clicked. The typical invocation is "java -jar foo.jar" from a command line.

Native launchers can be created on most platforms. For instance Microsoft Windows users who prefer having Windows EXE files can use tools such as JSmooth, Launch4J, WinRun4J or Nullsoft Scriptable Install System to wrap single JAR files into executables.

** DONE What is a Java Package?
*** Description
A Java package is a technique for organizing Java classes into namespaces similar to the modules of Modula, providing modular programming in Java.

Java packages can be stored in compressed files called JAR files, allowing classes to be downloaded faster as groups rather than individually. Programmers also typically use packages to organize classes belonging to the same category or providing similar functionality. A package provides a unique namespace for the types it contains. Classes in the same package can access each other's package-private and protected members.

*** Overview
In general, a package can contain the following kinds of types. A package allows a developer to group classes (and interfaces) together. These classes will all be related in some way – they might all have to do with a specific application or perform a specific set of tasks. The Java API is a collection of packages – for example, the javax.xml package. The javax.xml package and its subpackages contain classes to handle XML.

    
*** Using packages

In a Java source file, the package that this file's class or classes belong to is specified with the package keyword. 

- package is usually the first keyword in the source file. 
- At most, one package declaration can appear in a source file.

package java.awt.event;

To use a package's classes inside a Java source file, it is convenient to import the classes from the package with an import declaration. The following declaration:

import java.awt.event.*;

** DONE What is an Artifact?
An artifact is a file, usually a JAR, that gets deployed to a Maven repository.

A Maven build produces one or more artifacts, such as a compiled JAR and a "sources" JAR.

Each artifact has a group ID (usually a reversed domain name, like com.example.foo), an artifact ID (just a name), and a version string. The three together uniquely identify the artifact.

A project's dependencies are specified as artifacts.



** DONE What is the difference between  jar, ear, and war files?

These files are simply zipped files using java jar tool. These files are created for different purposes. Here is the description of these files:

** jar files
These files are with the .jar extension. The .jar files contain the libraries, resources and accessories files like property files.

** war files
These files are with the .war extension. The war file contains the web application that can be deployed on the any servlet/jsp container. The .war file contains jsp, html, javascript and other files for necessary for the development of web applications.

** ear files:
The .ear file contains the EJB modules of the applications.

**** Monday - 04/04/2016 - 08:43 PM PDT
After some investigation, I found out the java cli tool takes a Java class as an argument, but it can also take a jar. 

*** TODO Commands [2/3]
**** TODO javac [0/1]
***** Top Level
javac [ options ] [ sourcefiles ] [ @argfiles ]

- options
Command line options

- sourcefiles
One or more sourcefiles to be compiled (ie. MyClass.java)

- @argfiles:
One or more files that list source files. 
The -J option aren't allowed in these files

***** Description
The javac tool reads class and interface definitions, written in the Java programming  language, and compiles them into bytecode class files. 

Check "man javac" for more details.

***** Searching for Types
      
Compilers need information about a type whose definition did not appear in the source files given on the command line. 

The compiler needs type information for every class or interface used, extended or implemented in the source file. 

This includes classes and interfaces not explicityly mentioned in the source file but which provide information through inheritance. 

***** How the Search Occurs
      
When the compiler needs type info, it looks for a source file or class file which defines the type. It first searches:

1. Bootstrap and extension  classes
2. Then in the user class path ( default:current directory)
   - It is defined by setting the:
     1. CLASSPATH env variable
     2. the -classpath cli option
     3. See "Setting the Class Path" for more details

3. If you use -sourcepath,
   - the compiler searches the indicated path for source files;
   - else, the compiler searchers the user class path for:
     - Class files and Source files
***** Important Options       
***** TODO Questions [0/1]
****** TODO How do I compile lib files into a Java Class or Bundle?
**** DONE jar
The jar tool combines multiple files into a single JAR archive file. jar is a general purpose archiving and compression tool, based on ZIP and teh ZLIB compression format.

Almost exactly like the tar utility.

Designed to package Java appletes or applications into a single archive.
***** Executable Option

- m    

Includes name: value attribute pairs from the specified manifest file manifest in the file at META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.  

A name:  value  pair is added unless one already exists with the same name, in which case its value is updated.

On the command line, the letters m and f must appear in the same order that manifest  and  jarfile appear. Example use:

- jar cmf myManifestFile myFile.jar *.class

You  can  add special-purpose name: value attribute pairs to the manifest that aren't contained in the default manifest. Examples of such attributes would be those for vendor  information,  version information,  package  sealing, and to make JAR-bundled applications executable. See the JAR Files trail in the Java Tutorial and the Notes for Developers page for examples of using the m option.

**** DONE java
     
***** Description

The  java  tool launches a Java application.  It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading a specified class, and invoking that class's main method.  The  method  must  be  declared public  and  static , it must not return any value, and it must accept a String array as a parameter. The method declaration must look like the following:

- public static void main(String args[])

By default, the first non-option argument is the name of the class to be invoked.  A  fully-quali- fied class name should be used.  If the -jar option is specified, the first non-option argument is the name of a JAR archive containing class and  resource  files  for  the  application,  with  the startup class indicated by the Main-Class manifest header.

The  Java  runtime  searches for the startup class, and other classes used, in three sets of locations: the bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user class path.

Non-option arguments after the class name or JAR file name are passed to the main function.

***** Execute a Jar file

-jar   

Execute a program encapsulated in a JAR archive.  The first argument is the name of  a  JAR file  instead  of  a startup class name.  In order for this option to work, the manifest of the JAR file must contain a line of the form Main-Class:classname.  

Here, classname identifies the class having the public static void main(String[] args) method that serves as your application's starting point.  See the Jar tool reference page and the  Jar  trail  of  the Java Tutorial for information about working with Jar files and Jar-file manifests. 

When  you  use  this option, the JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other user class path settings are ignored. 

Note that JAR files that can be run with the "java -jar" option can have their execute per- missions  set  so  they  can  be run without using "java -jar". Refer to Java Archive (JAR) Files.
